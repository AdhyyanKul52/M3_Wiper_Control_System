## INTRODUCTION

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.

## WHAT
A wiper control system for an vehicle controls the speed of a wiper in accordance with the rain

## WHY
When rain hits a dedicated sensor that present on the windscreen, it sends the signal to move the wiper. When water is not detected by the sensor, the wiper automatically stops.

## WHEN
If the humidity level or the rain, deposited on the windshield is more then accordingly wiper will move. 

## WHERE
The invention relates generally to a wiper control system for an automotive windshield wiper, which automatically controls the operating speed of the wiper in the rainy weather.

## HOW
All automotive wipers are controlled by a microprocessor. Many wiper systems in cars today use a rain sensor to detect the speed at which the raindrops are falling on the windshield.
